# MonteCarlo Burger Simulation

This repository contains the code implementation and project report for a computational statistical treatment of information project, focusing on simulating a burger joint's operations using Monte Carlo techniques.

## Project Structure

- **TRABAJO_TMON.pdf**: The project report detailing the theoretical background, simulation model, computational model, and analysis of results.
- **PracticaFinal_documentada.R**: The R code implementation of the simulation model, properly documented for clarity and understanding.

## Simulation Details

The simulation model was implemented in R, utilizing Monte Carlo techniques. The code is structured to reflect the conceptual model of the burger joint's operations, including bread and meat production, burger assembly, customer arrivals, and sales.

## Analysis of Results

The project report includes an in-depth analysis of the simulation results, including metrics such as average customer and burger queue times, average number of customers and burgers in queues, average time and number of burgers in the system, percentage of customer and burger abandonment, total income, expenses, and profits.

## Conclusion

The simulation results suggest that optimizing the number of chefs is crucial for maximizing profits while balancing customer service and resource utilization. Further details and insights can be found in the project report.
